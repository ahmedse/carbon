## **Overview**
The platform will be a role-based system for managing carbon-related projects, collecting data (e.g., power, water usage), assigning tasks, and visualizing data. It will have a visually appealing, environmental-themed design and support rapid feature development for future modules.

---

## **Core Features**
### **1. User Roles**
- **Admin**:
  - Full control (global scope).
  - Manages users, roles, projects, and tasks.
  - Oversees all data and workflows.

- **Auditor**:
  - Project-specific read-only access.
  - Can view all data, tasks, and submissions for assigned projects.

- **Power/Water/Waste Data Owners**:
  - Limited scope to their assigned projects and modules (power, water, waste).
  - Responsible for entering or importing data, managing tasks, and visualizing data.

### **2. Look and Feel**
- **Color Palette**:
  - Primary Colors: Shades of **green** for sustainability.
  - Secondary Colors: **Blues** and neutral tones for contrast.
- **Typography**: Modern, sans-serif fonts like "Inter" or "Roboto."
- **Layout**:
  - **Top Navigation Bar**: Logo, user profile, logout.
  - **Side Menu**: Collapsible navigation for modules (Dashboard, Projects, Power Data, Water Data).
  - **Main Content Area**: Dynamic content based on user role.

### **3. Dashboards**
- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Global overview metrics: Total projects, users, tasks.
  - Visualizations (charts): Trends in power/water usage, comparisons between projects.
  - Quick Actions: Create projects, assign tasks.

- **Auditor Dashboard**:
  - Project-specific metrics: Assigned projects, latest submissions.
  - Visualizations for project trends.
  - Read-only access.

- **Data Owner Dashboard**:
  - Metrics for assigned projects and tasks.
  - Visualizations: Submission trends, pending tasks.
  - Quick Actions: Enter/import data.

### **4. Data Workflow**
- **Manual Data Entry**:
  - Simple forms for users to enter data (e.g., power usage, water usage).
  - Inputs include:
    - Date
    - Usage (e.g., kWh, liters)
    - Optional notes.
  - Validation:
    - Prevent duplicates for the same date/project.
    - Warn users of unusual data (e.g., "usage significantly higher than average").

- **CSV Imports**:
  - File upload for bulk data submission.
  - Backend parses and validates rows before saving.
  - Example CSV format:
    ```
    Date,Usage,Comments
    2025-04-20,500,"Maintenance spike"
    2025-04-21,450,"Normal operation"
    ```

- **Data Storage**:
  - Store raw data for future calculations (e.g., carbon equivalence).
  - Use timestamps to track relevance to dates.

- **Data Management**:
  - View, filter, and edit/delete data in tabular form.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Line charts for trends (time-series data).
  - Bar charts for comparisons (e.g., power vs. water usage).

## **Development Timeline**
### **Phase 1: MVP (Deliverable in 6 Days)**
#### **Day 1: Backend Setup**
- Set up Django project and database (PostgreSQL).
- Implement user authentication and role-based access control.

#### **Day 2: Frontend Setup**
- Set up React with Tailwind CSS.
- Build base layout:
  - Top navigation bar.
  - Side menu.

#### **Day 3: Admin Features**
- Create APIs for managing:
  - Users, roles, permissions.
  - Projects and task assignments.
- Build admin dashboard with:
  - Overview metrics (e.g., total projects, users).
  - Forms for project creation and user assignment.

#### **Day 4: Data Workflow**
- Add APIs for:
  - Manual data entry.
  - CSV uploads for bulk data.
  - Fetching data for visualizations.
- Build forms and CSV file upload components in React.

#### **Day 5: User Dashboards**
- Build dashboards for:
  - Admin (global overview).
  - Auditor (read-only project-specific data).
  - Data Owners (module-specific dashboards).

#### **Day 6: Polish and Deploy**
- Apply environmental theme (green tones, modern typography).
- Add animations for smooth transitions (e.g., menu dropdowns).
- Deploy on VPS (using Docker and NGINX).

### **Phase 2: Post-Launch Enhancements**
1. **Bilingual Support**:
   - Add Arabic support using:
     - Backend: `django-modeltranslation`.
     - Frontend: `react-i18next`.
   - Implement right-to-left (RTL) styling for Arabic.

2. **Advanced Dashboards**:
   - Add dynamic filters (e.g., filter by project, date range).
   - Include more detailed visualizations (e.g., stacked bar charts for combined metrics).

3. **Carbon Calculation Module**:
   - Add formulas to convert power/water data into carbon equivalence.
   - Build forms and reports for carbon calculations.

4. **Notifications**:
   - Add in-app notifications for:
     - Task assignments.
     - Data approvals/rejections.

5. **IoT Support**:
   - Integrate real-time data streaming via IoT devices.
