# Carbon Management Platform

A robust, extensible system for tracking, calculating, and reporting environmental data (water, electricity, vehicles, etc.) across projects and periods. Built for security, auditability, and future scalability.

---

## 🚀 Overview

- **Multi-project, multi-period, multi-module data collection**
- **Granular role-based access control (RBAC)**
- **Auditable calculation and reporting**
- **Modern React frontend (Material UI) & Django backend**
- **Supports containerized (Docker) and manual setup**
- **Designed for extensibility: supports API, advanced analytics, and multi-tenancy**

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: React (Vite) + Material UI
- **Backend**: Django + Django REST Framework + JWT Auth
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (MongoDB planned)
- **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Documentation & Design**: See [`docs/`](./docs) for API specs, workflows, and diagrams
