Certainly! Below is an updated, detailed macro/micro tasks progress file that takes into account the tasks already marked as finished in your current `progress.md`. Tasks already completed remain checked, and all actionable items for getting your platform up for a test project (single company, single project/period, RBAC, module data, calculations) are broken down into granular steps.

# Carbon Platform Development Progress

## **Phase 1: Core MVP for Test Project (Single Tenant - Internal Use)**

### **1. Backend Development**

#### **1.1. Core Models & Authentication**
- [x] Scaffold Django project and main apps
- [x] Implement User model
- [x] Implement Role model (Admin, Auditor, Data Owner)
- [x] Implement RoleAssignment model
- [x] Implement Context model (global/project/period)
- [x] Implement JWT-based authentication
- [x] Add initial data migration for users, roles, assignments

#### **1.2. Project, Period, Module Data**
- [x] Create Project model (single, for your company)
- [x] Create Period model (e.g., “2024”)
- [x] Create Module model (Water, Electricity, Vehicles, etc.)
- [ ] Implement ModuleSchema (hardcoded JSONField for each module, for now)
- [ ] Implement ModuleData model (JSONField for data, FK to period/module/user)
- [ ] Implement CalculationResult model (FK to period/module, result JSON)
- [ ] Seed initial modules and period

#### **1.3. API Endpoints**
- [ ] CRUD for users
- [ ] CRUD for roles and assignments
- [ ] CRUD for project, period, modules
- [ ] CRUD for module data (entry, update, delete)
- [ ] Calculation endpoint (trigger + result fetch)
- [ ] RBAC permission checks on all endpoints

#### **1.4. Admin & Utilities**
- [x] Register all models in Django admin
- [ ] Write unit tests for RBAC logic
- [ ] Write utility for permission checking
- [ ] Seed script for initial users, roles, project, period, modules

#### **1.5. Logging/Audit (Basic)**
- [ ] Implement simple logging of user actions (create/update/delete on module data)
- [ ] Log authentication and role changes

---

### **2. Frontend Development**

#### **2.1. Project Setup & Auth**
- [x] Initialize React project with Material UI
- [x] Set up role-based routing system
- [x] Configure Material UI theme
- [x] Create base folder structure:
  - [x] `src/components/`
  - [x] `src/layouts/`
  - [x] `src/pages/`
  - [x] `src/services/`
  - [x] `src/styles/`
  - [x] `src/utils/`
- [x] Implement login/logout with JWT
- [ ] Store user/role context in frontend state

#### **2.2. Layouts & Navigation**
- [ ] Build layouts for role-based dashboards
  - [ ] Design layout wrappers for each role (Admin, Auditor, Data Owner)
  - [ ] Implement role-based sidebar and nav components
- [ ] Add placeholder pages for Admin, Auditor, and Data Owner
  - [ ] Link dashboard routes to placeholders

#### **2.3. Data Entry & Review**
- [ ] UI for selecting period and module
- [ ] Dynamic form for module data entry (fields per module)
- [ ] Table/list view for module data (view, edit, delete)
- [ ] Calculation trigger button/UI
- [ ] Simple results/report view

#### **2.4. Role Management (Admin)**
- [ ] UI for viewing/assigning roles to users

#### **2.5. Basic Notifications**
- [ ] Show toast/messages for action success/error

---

### **3. DevOps & Deployment**

#### **3.1. Local Development**
- [x] Configure Docker for containerization
- [ ] Docker Compose for local stack
- [ ] Local PostgreSQL setup

#### **3.2. CI/CD**
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments
  - [ ] GitHub Actions/GitLab CI for backend tests/linting
  - [ ] Docker image build and push (staging)

#### **3.3. Seed/Test Environment**
- [ ] Seed script for initial environment
- [ ] Test login and all flows for each role

---

### **4. Testing & Validation**

#### **4.1. Manual QA**
- [ ] Test login and role switches
- [ ] Test data entry/review/calculation flows
- [ ] Test RBAC restrictions (role can/can’t access certain features)
- [ ] Test logging/audit output

#### **4.2. Automated Testing**
- [ ] Backend unit tests (RBAC, models, permissions)
- [ ] Frontend tests (if practical, for login/forms)

---

### **5. Documentation**

- [ ] Update README with setup instructions
- [ ] Add API documentation (endpoints, RBAC rules)
- [ ] Document data model (diagram + description)
- [ ] Add usage guide for internal testers

---

## **Phase 2: Expansion Preparation (to be started after Phase 1)**

- [ ] Design for multi-tenancy (tenant/org model, tenant isolation)
- [ ] Prepare abstraction for module schemas (to allow dynamic fields)
- [ ] Plan for NoSQL (MongoDB) migration for module data
- [ ] Extend logging/audit to full history/versioning
