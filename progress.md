# Carbon Platform Development Progress

## **Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation**
### Objective: Establish a robust foundation for the platform.

1. **Frontend Setup**:
   - [x] Initialize React project with Material UI
   - [x] Set up role-based routing system
   - [x] Configure Material UI theme
     - [x] Primary Palette: Green (sustainability)
     - [x] Secondary Palette: Blue (contrast)
   - [x] Create base folder structure:
     - `src/components/`
     - `src/layouts/`
     - `src/pages/`
     - `src/services/`
     - `src/styles/`
     - `src/utils/`
   - [ ] Build layouts for role-based dashboards
   - [ ] Add placeholder pages for Admin, Auditor, and Data Owner

2. **Backend Setup**:
